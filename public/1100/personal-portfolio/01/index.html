                <p>Hi there I am Hyrum! I am aspiring Software Engineer currently studying at Bridgerland Technical
                    College
                    in Logan, UT. I am 19 years old and have lived in Cache Valley since I was born. Some of my
                    interests
                    include music production, game development, gaming with my friends, and snowboarding! I hope to one
                    day
                    work for a company in a big city (hopefully one of the really big names), and I'm not letting
                    anything
                    get in my way. I want to show that I am a
                    hard worker who has a unique eye for solving complex problems, whether that be in a team or on my
                    own, I
                    always have something original to bring to the table.</p>
